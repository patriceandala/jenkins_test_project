## Threecolts TS hiring test

### The process

Please implement the 2 functions as described in the main_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.go file.

Requirements:

- In particular, do not add any external dependencies
- main.go should not have compiler errors
- All your code should exist within a single file: main_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.go
- If you write tests, these can live in a separate file. You can use github.com/stretchr/testify for them

At the end of the hour, please:

- Attach your solution main_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.go to the email/form
- Optional: if you wrote any tests, please attach them to the same email/form

If you have any questions take your best guess.
After delivering the solution, feel free to send comments or questions our way,

Best of luck,
The Threecolts team
